# Overview

The Center for Digital Trust, [https://c4dt.com](C4DT), started the 
Digital Trust Open Platform, DTOP, which will be a software platform enabling the development
of secure and trustworthy applications. DTOP will provide a mirror of the latest stable version
of the original software for our partners to directly use it. Development of the software
would continue happening in the lab's repositories.

We define three levels of refinement of our software:

1. DTOP - tested and reviewed software that is ready to be used
2. Incubator - software we want to promote to DTOP
3. Potential - other software that might be useful but that needs more work

Potential software that is identified to be of special interest will be promoted to the Incubator, 
once it meets minimal quality requirements.
Once software is in the Incubator, the C4DT engineer team will work together with the corresponding
lab to fix security issues and make sure that the documentation is complete for usage by
external partners.
